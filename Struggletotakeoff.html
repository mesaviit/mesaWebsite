    <p>
        <b> Firstly, let's understand what is aviation industry?</b>
       The aviation industry is the business sector dedicated to manufacturing and operating all types of aircraft. Air traffic controllers, when they are awake, are concerned with aviation safety.
        Origin
       The origin of the aerospace industry dates to 1903 when Wilbur and Orville Wright demonstrated an airplane capable of powered, sustained flight (see Wright flyer of 1903). The Wright brothers' success was due to detailed research and an excellent engineering-and-development approach.
       
    </p>
    <p><b>How much does aviation contributes to GDP?</b><br>
Aviation supports 65.5 million jobs worldwide and enables $2.7 trillion in global GDP. It allows people to have adventures in new countries, to relax on tropical beaches, to build business relationships and to visit friends and family.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Let's take a glance on Problems </h3>
    <p>
<h5>a)Increase in fuel prices </h5>
       Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) is one of the important sections of the industry. Indian government didn’t not reduce the jet fuel prices in proportion to the fall in international crude oil prices. But, when there is a rise in crude prices, it increases in the fuel cost would eventually increase the operation of the airline. Besides, it could compel airlines to go for an upward fare revision to offset the increased cost of operations.
      Why, the jet fuel accounts for 45 percent of an airline's cost of operation. For the past one year, the ATF price has witnessed an increase of nearly 30 percent and around 25 percent in just last six months.


<h5>b)Government intervention</h5>
       Frequent government intervention is proving to a great obstacle for the growth of Aviation industry. Several aviation experts have pointed out that India government should follows aviation industry free from policy hurdles like regulating airfares and slash taxes, including jet fuel. Besides, they advise the government to focus on building infrastructure and the air navigation system. The Indian aviation industry which contributed five per cent of GDP, offers four million jobs and another seven million jobs through tourism and related activities. So more efforts are needed, on creating infrastructure which will enable further growth.

<h5>c)Higher airport cost </h5>
         High Airport (aeronautical) Charges levied by Airport Authority of India are higher. These charges payable at the International airports are higher than those payable at the airports designated as Domestic airports. As a result, the domestic airlines in India are incurring additional costs at the international designated airports without deriving any extra facilities. According to a latest survey, the airport charges levied by the Indian airports (Domestic and International Terminal) are amongst the highest in the Asian and the Gulf countries. This adds more burden to aviation companies.


<h5>d)Severe competition </h5>
       There is a cut throat competition faced by the top airline due to ticket pricing. Established Airlines are threatened by low cost carriers, which are eating up their market share. In order to consolidate their market share, top premium airlines were forced to reduce their ticket fares to around 15- 20 per cent. Such a slash down in price will lead to a price war in the long run amongst the airlines with the only goal of increasing their market share.


<h5>e)Government Initiatives </h5>
       Allocation to Civil Aviation Ministry has been increased to Rs 6,602.86 crore (US$ 1,019.9 million) under Union Budget 2018-19. The government has launched the construction of Navi Mumbai airport which is expected to be built at a cost of US$ 2.58 billion. The first phase of the airport will be completed by the end of 2019. The Government of Andhra Pradesh is planning to develop Greenfield airports in six cities-Nizamabad, Nellore, Kurnool, Ramagundam, Tadepalligudem and Kothagudem under the PPP model. Rs 15,000 crore (US $ 2.32 billion) will be invested in 2018-19 for expanding existing terminals and constructing 15 new ones.

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h5>Challenges </h5>
                <p> Aviation industry is facing challenges like higher fare to cover up their cost, increase in operational cost, taxation regime, high airport charges, maintenance charges, high debt content in the capital structure, high competition, infrastructural requirements, rupee depreciation, and increased cost of fuel.</p>
            
            <h5>How does the covid-19 affects aviation industry? </h5>
   <p> When the COVID-19 crisis hit air transport, the whole aviation industry was affected. The change in the behaviour of passengers following the COVID-19 crisis, travel restrictions and the ensuing economic crisis have resulted in a dramatic drop in demand for airline services.</p>
</div>   
</div>
</div>
   <h5>Current Scenario -(2021)</h5>
   <p> India's aviation industry is expected to witness 35,000 crore ($4.99 billion) investment in the next four years. Currently, North America is the largest MRO market, accounting for around 40 per cent of the world market. Asia-Pacific, China and India combined represent 22 per cent of the market.</p>

   <h5>Future Of aviation industry in India </h5>
   <p> India has carved out a position for itself as the third-largest domestic aviation market in the world; and is expected to surpass the UK to become the third-largest air passenger market (for both domestic as well as international) by 2024.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p> India’s aviation industry has a huge potential and offers huge growth opportunities. One of the key factors which favours such a expectation is that 40 per cent is the upwardly mobile middle class are starting to prefer air travel as the prefect mode of transport. So government must engage and collaborate with industry stakeholders to implement efficient and rational decisions that would enable the growth of India’s civil aviation industry. With the right kind of infrastructure and policies with thorough focus on quality, cost and passenger interest, India would surely achieve the third-largest aviation market by 2025. <br>
      So what do you think, will aviation industries overcome all these problems?
