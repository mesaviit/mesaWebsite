        <ul>
            <li>Title sponsorship-</li>

            <li>Brand sponsorship-</li>
            <p>
                Many multi national, national and local companies advertise their orginazitations logo on jerseys of the
                players, statium boards, pitch, boundry lines,etc. The logos printed on the chest area are the most
                expensive places for the sponsors. This is the major source of income for teams and stadium as well.
            </p>
        </ul>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="blog-img/pass-304656_1280.png" alt="" class="left-img ">

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <li class="order-list">Ticket sales- </li>
                    <p>
                        On an average of 4 crores is earned every match through selling tickets, from which major chunk goes to home
                        team (owner) and some amount is paid to the cricket association of that particular stadium.
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    <li class="order-list">Merchandise sales-</li>
                <p>
                    Many teams sells their merchandise like caps,wrist watches,T-shirts,etc. All this money goes to the team
                    owners.
                    Player trading is also a good source of income to the owners,many new and young players gets chance to
                    showcase their talent to the world.

                <p>
                    Probably this is the smallest chunk of money which is earned by team. In 2019 this was 20 crores for winner
                    and 12.5 croress for runner up team. Half of the money will go to the franchise whereas the other half will
                    be distributed among the players.
                </p>
            </ol>

        their other support staff and coach salaries, administration team,etc.Thse expenses can very from 130-160
        crores.
        Initially it was tough to make profits to the franchises but now a days the media rights increased by 25% and
        sponsorship revenue has increased by 4 times. Currently Mumbai Indians has the highest total brand value of 809
        crores in the IPL followed by Chennai Super Kings of 732 crores.
