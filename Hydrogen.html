    <p>The 21th generation has witnessed private companies taking humans to space, sunsets of mars, architectural structures of small scale being 3D printed, google's driverless cars. The pace at which humanity is advancing is remarkable. But let’s not forget Sir. Isaac Newton's third law of physics, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. These inventions and their sustenance have impacted Earth in major dimensions. It won’t be wrong to say humans are on the verge of reaching the end of relying on non-renewable sources like coal, oil and natural gas. To save and to have a future for the next generation it is significant for us today to find alternatives of energy.</p>

                    One such extraordinary solution is the Fuel cell electric vehicle which draws power from hydrogen. This model uses electric energy to power its electric motor, this electric energy is produced with fuel cells powered by hydrogen. It can be an excellent solution to cure the pollution issue as they emit water vapour and warm air. <br>
                    In a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, hydrogen reacts with oxygen, this reaction creates electrical energy which further powers the electrical motor of the car. This reaction, also known as hydrogen combustion, provides power in the engine. This is accomplished through the use of a gasoline delivery and injection mechanism. When used, a small quantity of motor oil, similar to that found in petrol engines, hydrogen fuel cell achieve zero emissions.<br>

    <p>Hydrogen is a renewable source of energy which is willingly present in nature. It has a lot of potential as hydrogen fuel produces an immense amount of energy as compared to the other fuels. In terms of cost the companies do not need to establish processing plants to produce or dig out hydrogen from the surface of nature. The time utilised for charging a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is five times faster as compared to that of electric cars.</p>

                <p> In spite of being in the good books, today we do not observe many companies who employs this principle to manufacture their cars. The reasons behind it are: the need for platinum, platinum acts as catalyst for the energy generation process. Considering the present conditions the platinum is not readily available in the market today. Raw material used in the production can be expensive. Hydrogen needs to be extracted from the water by the process of electrolysis. This process can be complicated and needs investment for the hydrogen fuel to be used as a resource. The hydrogen fuel cell can be lethal due to its highly combustible nature which prevents the companies from using it.  The fuel tank of the hydrogen car consumes a lot of space which further adds to the cost. Due to its less demand there are no adequate fuel stations network for people to use it on a day to day basis.
                    <br><br>Tata Motors & ISRO has revealed India’s first hydrogen fuel cell bus in India. The Hydrogen Powered Star bus Fuel Cell bus is a zero emission mass transport solution, for inter-city commute and has been developed in partnership with ISRO.

    <p>Combining hydrogen gas and oxygen, the fuel cell produces electricity to power the electric motor, with water and heat as a by-product. This is the first time an Indian Manufacturer has ventured in this direction and indeed it is a proud moment for all of India.</p>

            <p>After observing both sides of the story the main question stands in front- how do we overcome these challenges? Companies like Toyota, Hyundai are the major contenders who are developing on these concepts abroad and Tata Motors in India. An alternative which is affordable in terms of cost with standard quality and focuses on fulfilling the needs of the future generation without hampering planet health will be considered as a feasible solution for transportation in future.
