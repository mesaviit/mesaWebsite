    <p>Hosting the Olympic games is one of the proudest and honorable moments for the country and where there are bids ranging in tens of millions of dollars just to get a chance to host the Olympic games, is it really economic to host the games where the development costs can range in multi million dollars?

    </p>
    <p>Before the 20th century making revenues through the games was difficult and its was hugely funded by the public and the larger economies were left to bear the expenses but in the recent decades Olympics have got multiple sources of revenue like sponsorships, brand deals, broadcasting revenue, etc. In the 1970’s after many new games were introduced and the participation of athletes started rapidly growing the overall cost of the games skyrocketed. In 1976 at the Summer Olympics in Montreal there were huge cost overruns, from the initial projected cost of $124 million dollars to cost overruns of up to 720% which left the city’s taxpayers in a $1.5 billion-dollar dept, leaving no bids for the next games and Los Angeles as the only bidder for the 1984 games, with LA’s pre-developed stadiums and infrastructure they were able to cut many significant costs and come out with a $215 million net profit. This success led to a rise in the no. of cities and countries bidding for the coming games. 
    </p>
    <p>Fast-forward to the 21st century, the expenses have risen to tens of billions of dollars with a record high cost of $50 billion during the 2014 Sochi winter Olympics held in Russia, whereas the revenue is nowhere near the initial costs. So why do countries heavily invest in the Olympics?

                <p>Firstly, it creates a sense of national pride among the citizens, encourages a sense of sportsmanship and has also helped develop many international relations between countries.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the hosting countries see an increase in trade, which can also lead to an increase in foreign investment. In the hosting regions of summer Olympics it's seen on an average that the regional per capita GDP rises by 3-4% relative to the national average whereas for winter Olympics there is no significant rise.</p>
                <p>Many countries upgrade communication and transportation systems, buildings, infrastructure, and housing. These overall developments help the economy for years to come after the games are finished and during the Olympics there is a huge boost in travel and tourism related spending since people from across the world visit to watch the games.

    <p>In emerging economies hosting the games is rarely economic and has also left many places bankrupt which have developed many infrastructural assets from scratch which later turned into huge liabilities on the government, so it is a huge task to the government to capitalize the assets efficiently and put them to good use in the latter years. Despite many controversies, in recent years, countries have managed to maximize the greater upside of hosting the games.
